//! Partition of time into slices.
//!
//! Provides an encapsulation for calculating time slices that is consistent when computed
//! by different nodes. This is used to group Kitsune2 op data into time slices for combined hashes.
//! Giving multiple nodes the same time slice boundaries allows them to compute the same combined
//! hashes, and therefore effectively communicate which of their time slices match and which do not.
//!
//! A time slice is defined to be an interval of time that is closed (inclusive) at the start and
//! exclusive at the end. That is, the time slice includes the start timestamp but not the end.
//!
//! Time slices are partitioned into two types: full slices and partial slices. Full slices are
//! always of a fixed size, while partial slices are of varying sizes. Full slices occupy
//! historical time, while partial slices occupy recent time.
//!
//! The granularity of time slices is determined by the `factor` parameter. The chosen factor
//! determines the size of time slices. Where 2^X means "two raised to the power of X", the size of
//! a full time slice is 2^factor * [UNIT_TIME]. Partial time slices vary in size from
//! 2^(factor - 1) * [UNIT_TIME] down to 2^0 * [UNIT_TIME] (i.e. [UNIT_TIME]). There is some
//! amount of time left over that cannot be partitioned into smaller slices.
//!
//! Because recent time is expected to change more frequently, combined hashes for partial slices
//! are stored in memory. Full slices are stored in the Kitsune2 op store.
//!
//! The algorithm for partitioning time is as follows:
//!   - Reserve a minimum amount of recent time as a sum of possible partial slice sizes.
//!   - Allocate as many full slices as possible.
//!   - Partition the remaining time into smaller slices. If there is space for two slices of a
//!     given size, then allocate two slices of that size. Otherwise, allocate one slice of that
//!     size. Larger slices are allocated before smaller slices.
//!
//! As time progresses, the partitioning needs to be updated. This is done by calling the
//! [PartitionedTime::update] method. The update method will:
//!    - Run the partitioning algorithm to determine whether new full slices can be allocated and
//!      how to partition the remaining time into partial slices.
//!    - Store the combined hash of any new full slices in the Kitsune2 op store.
//!    - Store the combined hash of any new partial slices in memory.
//!    - Update the `next_update_at` field to the next time an update is required.
//!
//! As an example, consider a factor of 9. This means that full slices are 2^9 = 512 times the [UNIT_TIME].
//! With a unit time of 15 minutes, that means full slices are 512 * 15 minutes = 7680 minutes = 128 hours.
//! So every 5 days, a new full slice is created.
//! The partial slices reserve at least 2^8 + 2^7 ... 2^0 = 519 times the [UNIT_TIME], so 519 * 15 minutes
//! = 7785 minutes = 129.75 hours. That gives roughly 5 days of recent time.
//!
//! A lower factor allocates less recent time and more slices to be stored but is more granular when
//! comparing time slices with another peer. A higher factor allocates more recent time and fewer
//! slices to be stored but is less granular when comparing time slices with another peer.
