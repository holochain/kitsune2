//! Partition of the hash space.
//!
//! The space of possible hashes is mapped to a 32-bit location. See [Id::loc](::kitsune2_api::id::Id::loc)
//! for more information about this. Each agent is responsible for storing and serving some part of
//! the hash space. This module provides a structure that partitions the hash space into 512
//! equally-sized DHT arcs.
//!
//! Each space partition manages a [PartitionedTime] structure that is responsible for managing the
//! time slices for that space partition. The interface of this module is largely responsible for
//! delegating the updating of time slices to the inner time partitions. This ensures all the time
//! partitions are updated in lockstep, which makes reasoning about the space-time partitioning
//! easier.
//!
//! This module must be informed about ops that have been stored. There is no active process here
//! that can look for newly stored ops. When a batch of ops is stored, the [PartitionedHashes] must
//! be informed and will split the ops into the right space partition based on the location of the op.
//! Ops are then pushed to the inner time partition for each space partition. It is the time
//! partitions that are responsible for updating the combined hash values.
//!
//! That completes the high level information for this module, what follows is a more detailed
//! explanation of the design.
//!
//! The bit-depth of the location roughly determines how evenly ops are distributed across the
//! partitions. For example, an 8-bit location can only map op hashes to 256 possible locations,
//! which would not use the top half of the partitions here. A 32-bit location retains enough
//! information to use the full range of partitions and can be calculated inside a 32-bit integer.
//! A 16-bit or 64-bit location would work too, and the choice between the options is not
//! quantified here.
//!
//! The choice of 512 partitions is a tradeoff between the minimum amount of data that a node must
//! store to participate in the network and the amount of data that must be sent over the network
//! to discover what op data needs to be fetched. Every node will store between 0 and 512
//! partitions. For nodes that are choosing to store data, the minimum they can store is 1
//! partition. Or in other words, 1/512th of the total data. To put this in context, an application
//! that has a complete data set of 5TB would require a minimum of 10GB of storage dedicated to
//! that app to be able to participate in the network.
//! It is important to note though, that each partition is managing a [PartitionedTime] structure
//! which requires some memory and processing to maintain. Nodes that take on more partitions will
//! have more work to do and will have to send more data during gossip rounds. That happens when
//! there are changes to data that has made it into a time slice and become part of a combined
//! hash. Generally, nodes will be able to just sync "what's new" but for catch-up, this is true.
//! As a consequence, a new network that hasn't yet gained enough members to start reducing how
//! many partitions are covered by each node will have a higher overhead for each node.
//! It is the responsibility of the gossip module to work out how to be efficient about sending
//! the minimum amount of data required to keep all nodes up to date. However, the worst case is
//! that 512 combined hashes must be sent to find out which partition has a mismatch for a given
//! time slice. Over time, there will be more time slices to check.
//! Therefore, the choice of 512 should be thought of as a best-effort choice to ask a reasonable
//! amount of work and storage from each node in a large network but being no larger than that
//! so we don't add overhead to gossip.
//!
//! It is also important to note that nodes may have to store the full 512 partitions if the
//! number of peers in the network is not high enough. The network must have enough peers that
//! data is still stored redundantly before the number of partitions per node can be reduced.
//!
//! It should also be understood that as well as the minimum storage requirement and the
//! possibility of having to store more data on smaller networks, a user of a Kitsune2 app is
//! likely to want to use data that isn't stored on their own node. That means that although they
//! are free to delete that data again once they are done with it, the amount of data stored and
//! served by a node is not the only storage it may require. It is just a lower bound on the
//! free space that a node will need to have available.
